Rebooting Procedures (ISP)

To reboot the ISP:
 
Click on the Start button (in the lower left)
Then Shutdown 
A box will appear that has three prompts (two drop down boxes and one input field, for comment)
The first box allows you to choose what kind of shutdown you want (i.e. Restart, Shutdown or Disconnect). 
For a reboot, you will want to choose Restart
The second will also be a drop down bar that allows you to specify if this was a planned action
The final field is for a comment on why you are rebooting the ISP. Type in a comment and click OK.  
Hold a ping on the ISP until it is back up. You can also log back into the server to verify everything came up normally.
 
When rebooting ISPs; install any updates that are ready to be installed. Follow the instructions below:
 
Click on the yellow Windows update icon (located in the system tray, at the lower right corner)
Make sure Express Install is selected and click Install.
If the yellow  HYPERLINK "onenote:" \l "General%20Server%20Systems&section-id={201CEE57-6ADE-4F33-BE0E-97963A21FC14}&page-id={6BBF4042-2E5B-4258-A06D-01DD258F470E}&object-id={E113B37A-A918-0F25-211D-38D383E93A93}&E&base-path=gofs\\departments\\Helpdesk\\Documentation\\Troubleshooting%20Guide\\Servers.one" Windows update shield icon is missing
Open a command prompt and type 'wuauclt /detectnow'  (without the '  ')
If the shield still does not appear, there are no updates available. Make a note in the ticket and continue with the reboot. If there are 3 or more with no updates, send an e-mail to the Server Systems On-call (not the group), so they are aware and can investigate further. 
If there are any other issues during the reboot, continue with the reboot, make notes in the ticket and assign the ticket to the Server Systems group
